## Design work

I've worked in multidisciplinary teams doing agile delivery on individual services, and across entire portfolios of products.

I work with many other people in their roles, including Designers, Researchers, Developers, Product Managers, Architects, Test Engineers and Stakeholders, and across various communities in larger organisations.

A lot of what I do is about bringing people together and breaking down silos. I organise and facilitate community meetings, workshops and training sessions to make sure services are designed consistently and built to the right standards.

Depending on the phase and the scope of a project, I design for the big picture, or for the detail.

I design interactions, content, visuals, maps and blueprints for products and services.

I was part of the original [GOV.UK Design System Working Group](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/design-system-working-group/) and reviewed and provided feedback on dozens of submissions for the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk) against their [contribution criteria](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/contribution-criteria/).

I've assessed the design on over 40 services at [GOV.UK Service Assessments](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments), to make sure they are designed correctly in line with the [GOV.UK Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard), and that they use common patterns, components and best practice wherever possible.
