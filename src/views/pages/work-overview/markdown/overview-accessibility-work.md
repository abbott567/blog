## Accessibility work

I work to embed accessibility in User Centred Design across large organisations. I've built communities, practices, and lead on accessibility strategy, implementing best practice, training and support for product teams.

I work with Directors and Deputy Directors to implement accessibility strategy, set Objective Key Results and define Key Performance Indicators.

I work with product teams, senior stakeholders and communities of practice. I run meet-ups, workshops and training sessions to make sure accessibility standards are understood and adhered to.

I worked to create the 'Accessibility Specialist' job role in DWP and collaborated with other departments to define it as a [Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) role](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-specialist) in Government.

I designed, built and maintain the DWP Accessibility Manual, and I give [talks](/talks) regularly on the topics of accessibility, inclusion and neurodiversity.
