# Hello, my name is Craig.

I spend my days embedding accessibility into user centred design in one of the UK's largest Government departments.

I love to talk, design things and solve problems. I have [combined presentation ADHD](https://www.additudemag.com/3-types-of-adhd/), so sometimes I talk a little too much or get distracted from the problem. But I'm passionate about breaking down the stigma of mental health, so I think it's important to talk openly about mine.
