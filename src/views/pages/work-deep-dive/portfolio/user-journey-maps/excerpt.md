![Overview of a full user journey map. It's too small to read, but it shows a grid layout with rows and columns. The map is broken down into more understandable chunks further on in this article.](/images/work/user-journey-map-full.jpg)

User Journey Maps are similar to a [Service Blueprint](/work/service-blueprints), but they are simpler and are usually limited to one actor.

They feature actions, pain points, mood and quotes. All that good stuff you need as a designer!
