A11y Palette is an accessible colour palette designed to meet a contrast ratio of 4.5:1. By using a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 it will always meet the minimum requirement to pass 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum).

Colours are available in both Hex and RGB, so you have no excuses for not using an accessible colour combination on your PowerPoint presentation.
     
The contrast ratio for each combination is also provided automatically.
