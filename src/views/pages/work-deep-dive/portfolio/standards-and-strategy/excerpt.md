This work is also outlined in my blog post: [Defining a strategy for accessibility](/blog/defining-a-strategy-for-accessibility).

The standard of the accessibility work was inconsistent. There were only pockets of the organisation doing accessibility work well.

I created a strategy which focused on compliance, culture and education, to improve accessibility across the organisation.

I mapped and delivered high impact work in each category, creating a series of short and long term goals. Each goal was attached to an Objective Key Result (OKR) and measured using Key Performance Indicators (KPI).
