        This is my portfolio and everything in here is my work, but I believe 
        collaboration is key.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've worked in small start-ups with just 4 people, and I've worked in huge 
        organisations with close to 96,000 employees.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever the size of the organisation, I never work in isolation. 
        Every piece of work listed here will have had input and 
        influence from some of the amazing people I've worked with over the years.

      <p>
        I've worked in multidisciplinary teams doing agile delivery on individual 
        services, and across entire portfolios of products.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work with many other people in their roles, including Designers, 
        Researchers, Developers, Product Managers, Architects, Test Engineers 
        and Stakeholders, and across various communities in larger organisations.
      </p>
      <p>
        A lot of what I do is about bringing people together and breaking down silos. 
        I organise and facilitate community meetings, workshops and training 
        sessions to make sure services are designed consistently and built to 
        the right standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on the phase and the scope of a project, I design for the big 
        picture, or for the detail. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I design interactions, content, visuals, maps and blueprints for products 
        and services.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was part of the original <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/design-system-working-group/">
        GOV.UK Design System Working Group</a> and reviewed and provided feedback 
        on dozens of submissions for the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk">
        GOV.UK Design System</a> against their 
        <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/contribution-criteria/">
        contribution criteria</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've assessed the design on over 40 services at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments">
        GOV.UK Service Assessments</a>, to make sure they are designed correctly 
        in line with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard">
        GOV.UK Service Standard</a>, and that they use common patterns, components 
        and best practice wherever possible.

      <p>
        I work to embed accessibility in User Centred Design across large organisations.
        I've built communities, practices, and lead on accessibility strategy, 
        implementing best practice, training and support for product teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work with Directors and Deputy Directors to implement accessibility 
        strategy, set Objective Key Results and define Key Performance Indicators.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work with product teams, senior stakeholders and comminities of practice. 
        I run meet-ups, workshops and training sessions to make sure accessibility 
        standards are understood and adhered to.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked to create the 'Accessibility Specialist' job role in DWP and 
        collaborated with other departments to define it as a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-specialist">
        Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) role</a> in Government.
      </p>
      <p>
        I designed, built and maintain the DWP Accessibility Manual, and I give 
        <a href="/talks">talks</a> regularly on the topics of accessibility, 
        inclusion and neurodiversity.

      <p>
        It's common for large organisations to focus all of their efforts on the rules. 
        All the guidance, all the processes and all the governance, they all focus 
        on the same thing. Compliance!
      </p>
      <p>
        It's easy to see why a lot of organisations do this. On the surface, 
        compliance is the obvious way to see the risks and measure the progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the problem with this is you're effectively demanding people 
        pass an exam without really teaching them the subject matter. Mandating 
        compliance with no focus on education is an impossible task for everybody 
        involved. It can lead to poor performance and vanity metrics. People get 
        things wrong, cut corners or eventually they just give up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your strategy needs to be sustainable. It needs to be built from the 
        ground up, embedding accessibility into the very fabric of your organisation.

      <p>
        WCAGify is a simple function for people who need to reference the Web 
        Content Accessibility Guidelines frequently and are tired of copying and 
        pasting.
      </p>
      <p>
        WCAGify looks up WCAG 2.1 criteria based on a reference number supplied 
        as a string and returns an object with the URL and name etc. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It means you don't have to get the criterion name 100% correct as long 
        as you know the reference number. It also adds consistency to your reports 
        by returning the name exactly as it's formatted in the WCAG 2.1 standard.
