I’m at that age now where all my friends are into having babies. Because of this, I ended up browsing [kidly.co.uk](http://kidly.co.uk). It’s an eCommerce site aimed at gifts for 0-4-year-olds. They do a great job of selling themselves as a ‘by people for people’ kind of company. There are fluffy images of the team looking happy. The about us section is full of references to parenting so that people can relate.

I get this type of marketing. It’s smart. It bypasses your brain's neocortex and buries itself deep into your emotional core. If you relate to these people, and they seem like you, you’re more likely to buy from them. It’s genius.

I don't have a problem with this type of marketing, until it begins to encroach on the user experience.
