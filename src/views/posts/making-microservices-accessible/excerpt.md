The term &lsquo;[microservice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices)&rsquo; is becoming more and more popular when you look across the Digital landscape of a lot of big organisations. 

Several Government departments, and several large organisations I've spoken to recently, are all looking at this approach; because, if executed well, it saves time and money, and they create consistency for users.

However, as more and more organisations try to leverage microservices, the pitfalls of accessibility are perhaps not being fully considered.
