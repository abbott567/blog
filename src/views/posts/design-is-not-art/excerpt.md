Design and art go hand in hand. But they're not the same thing.

When I was younger, I identified as a graphic designer. I'd design logos and flyers for nightclubs in Newcastle. When you're doing this kind of thing, the lines between art and design blur a lot. I didn't know the difference.

I'd combine art with principles such as the golden ratio, irradiation phenomenon and overshoot. I'd pick typefaces to best represent the brand of the company I was designing for. There was some science to it, but it was still open to opinion. Somebody could still decide they didn't like my work. And clients often did.
