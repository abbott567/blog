excerpt: |
  A talk about what prototypes are, why we use them, and how to avoid some common mistakes. Techniques and resources you can use, along with some working examples so you can build a prototype of your own.

  Examples of things that have tripped me up in the past as well as suggesting tools we can use to help us test our designs.
