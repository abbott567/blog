excerpt: |
  In this talk I cover some of the shortcomings of accessibility regulations and standards, how we design better products and services for neurodivergent people, and aim to broaden the conversations about the role of accessibility in user-centred design. You can [watch the recording of Beyond Accessibility Regulations, from Accessibility Scotland](https://vimeo.com/867298745).
