# Hello, my name is Craig

I'm the former Head of Accessibility at the Department for Work and Pensions and the creator of the DWP Accessibility Manual. 

I'm a design lead and accessibility specialist by trade, and my focus is user centred design.

I love to deliver [talks](/talks), design things and solve problems. 

I have [combined presentation ADHD](https://www.additudemag.com/3-types-of-adhd/), so sometimes I talk a little too much or get distracted from the problem.

But, I'm passionate about breaking down the stigma of mental health, so I think it's important to talk openly about mine!
