# Hello, my name is Craig

I'm the former Head of Accessibility at the Department for Work and Pensions and the creator of the DWP Accessibility Manual. 

I'm a design lead and accessibility specialist, and my focus is user centred design.

I love to deliver [talks](/talks), design things and solve problems. 

I"m Autistic and I have ADHD. I'm passionate about breaking down the stigma of mental health and neurodivergence, so I think it's important to talk openly about mine!
