Although this is a personal website and not covered by accessibility law, I want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. This means you can:
- zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate all of the website using a keyboard
- navigate all of the website using speech recognition software
- listen to all of the website using a screen reader

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.
