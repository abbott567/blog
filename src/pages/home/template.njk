        Hello, my name is Craig.
      </h1>
      <p>
        I spend my days embedding accessibility into user centred design in one of the UK's largest Government departments.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love to talk, design things and solve problems. I have <a href="https://www.additudemag.com/3-types-of-adhd/">combined presentation ADHD</a>, 
        so sometimes I talk a little too much or get distracted from the problem. But I'm passionate about breaking down the stigma of mental health, 
        so I think it's important to talk openly about mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can read my <a href="blog">blog</a> posts, check out my <a href="talks">talks</a> or have a look at some of the <a href="work">work</a> I've done.
      </p>

        If you get stuck with anything or just want to say "Hi", please reach out.
      </p>

        Thanks, <br />
        Craig
