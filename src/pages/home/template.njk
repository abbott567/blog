      Hello, my name is Craig.
    </h1>
    <p>
      I spend my days embedding accessibility into user centred design in one of the UK's largest Government departments.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love to talk, design things and solve problems. I have <a href="https://www.additudemag.com/3-types-of-adhd/">combined presentation ADHD</a>, 
      so sometimes I talk a little too much or get distracted from the problem. But I'm passionate about breaking down the stigma of mental health, 
      so I think it's important to talk openly about mine.
    </p>
