## Key Achievements

### Accessibility as a Specialism
In 2021, I created and implemented the role of “Accessibility Specialist” and formed the accessibility practice at DWP. It was the first time in the history of the department that people were hired solely for their expertise in accessibility.

It involved a lot of stakeholder management, working with HR, policy and finance, defining job specifications, behaviours and skills for various levels of seniority: associate, working level, senior and lead.

During my tenure, I hired several accessibility specialists at various levels using the framework. Most had impairments and lived experience, which made my team the most diverse in the organisation in terms of representation.

My work and the definition of the role was used in the formation of the GOV.UK Accessibility Specialist role, which is now published in the Government Digital and Data Profession Capability Framework.

### Reporting and accountability structures
At DWP, we had no definitive data on what products we had, which ones were in scope of accessibility regulations and how many were compliant.
I conducted a mass-audit, talking to Directors, Deputy Directors and product teams to understand what products we had, their technology stacks and what accessibility work they had undertaken.

First, I created a data model for hundreds of digital products, with key information, like their chain of responsibility and any documentation they had to evidence their compliance status.

Then I created a generator, which used the data model to produce fully accessible HTML reports and email templates, which I used to efficiently report month-on-month to multiple stakeholders about risks they were carrying and the progress they were making towards compliance.

This kept accessibility work on everybody's radar as a priority and increased compliance by over 50%. By providing information in a transparent and easy to understand format, it helped people hold each other accountable

### The DWP Accessibility Manual
Accessibility is challenging, and I found that a lot of the useful information to understand it was spread out across the internet and difficult to find.

I created the DWP Accessibility Manual, to try and put a lot of the information you need in one place. It covered regulations and standards, best practices, tools and resources. But, most importantly, it covered “guidance for your job role”, where it would outline accessibility considerations in the context of your role, rather than it always just being in the context of WCAG or frontend development.

The project received widespread praise. It has inspired similar projects in other organisations and features in the GOV.UK Service Manual.

### Challenging the IAAP certification process
I wrote an article titled “Stop trying to recruit unicorns with acorns”, based on my research and observations around the culture of hiring accessibility specialists, and how the roles are bloated and underpaid.

I also used the article to highlight that many organisations require candidates to be IAAP certified (International Association of Accessibility Professionals), which mimics traditional academic certification processes using seated exams and invigilators, despite research showing that people with cognitive disabilities and neurodivergent people struggle this process.

I argued that the certification process is reminiscent of the current education system, which often fails people with accessibility needs and contributes massively to the disability pay-gap, and I worry it will isolate accessibility experts with lived experience from the industry.

Off the back of the article, IAAP agreed to review the certification process in their 2024 strategic considerations. Although it remains unchanged for now, I’m still proud that I am helping to at least table conversations around it.
