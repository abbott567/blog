The [DWP Accessibility Manual](https://accessibility-manual.dwp.gov.uk) is one of the projects I'm most proud of. It is a collection of accessibility guidance and best practice all in one place.

I've contributed countless hours, pushed over 60,000 lines of code, written pages and pages of guidance, but I want it to be owned by the community. So, it's completely open source. [View the DWP Accessibility Manual on GitHub](https://github.com/dwp/accessibility-manual), contribute to it, and feel free to reuse any of the codebase for your own projects.

The project is based heavily on the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/), only it is using a different configuration behind the scenes to make it feel more like the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs). It uses [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html) and [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), so pages and guidance are easy to update and contribute to.
