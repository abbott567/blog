      Although this is a personal website and not covered by accessibility law, 
      I want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. 
      This means you should be able to:
      <ul class="list list--bullet">
        <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
        <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
        <li>
          listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the 
          most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
