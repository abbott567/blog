The [GOV.UK Wireframing Kit for Sketch](https://github.com/dwp/sketch_wireframing_kit) is a no-code design solution I created for designers in Government. 

It is a library of GOV.UK styles, patterns and components you can download from the [community resources in the GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/resources-and-tools/#create-prototypes-and-wireframes) so you can quickly design wireframes and prototypes for Government digital services without needing to know HTML, CSS or JavaScript.

Until version 5.0 the kit was solely my work. It is now maintained by the cross Gov design community.
