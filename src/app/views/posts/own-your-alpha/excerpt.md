In Government our digital services get assessed at each stage of their journey. From Discovery into Alpha. Alpha through Beta. And Beta into Live. 

Every service that ends up on GOVUK will have to go through this. Each one assessed against the [service standard for Government](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard).

A panel of trained assessors will conduct the assessment. Each panel member from a different discipline within digital. The panel will cover the team setup. Their design and research, and their chosen technology stack.

From my time as an assessor, I've noticed teams don't always conduct Alphas correctly.
