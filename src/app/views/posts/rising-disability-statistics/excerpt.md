The number of people in the UK living with a disability is rising.

It's currently accepted that in the UK it is around 1 in 5 people, or 20%. And, from 2012 to 2019, there has been a further 3% increase in the 'official statistics'.

The number of children reported to have a disability has risen 2%, from 6% to 8%

The number of working age adults reported to have a disability has risen 3%, from 16% to 19%.

The number of adults over State Pension age reported to have a disability has risen 1%, from 45% to 46%.

Those are the facts. Based on [2011/2012 GOV.UK Disability Facts and Figures](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/disability-facts-and-figures/disability-facts-and-figures) and [2019/2020 GOV.UK Family Resources Survey](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/family-resources-survey-financial-year-2019-to-2020/family-resources-survey-financial-year-2019-to-2020#disability-1). The rest of this post is mainly my thoughts, and definitely up for debate!
