We use [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) by [Deque](https://www.deque.com/) regularly as part of acceptance tests. 

With [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/accessibility_testing.html) now offering [PA11Y](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pa11y) as part of the Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline with zero config, I wanted to understand how it stacked up against axe-core. Can you drop axe-core for PA11Y? Can you drop PA11Y for axe-core? Should you use both?
