There's a common misconception that people using assistive technologies are an edge case. That they fall into that 1% where people disable Javascript. But, this couldn't be further from the truth. 

I'm going to show you why it's important to make your website accessible.

There are a few of disclaimers:

- I'm combining figures from reports in 2014, 2016 and 2017. So the results won't be representative of a single historic year. Instead, they will be the most up to date figures I could find.

- The reports will only capture those with a diagnosis. Those with a registered disability. Or, those who took part in research by the Office for National Statistics. It's likely there are more people who have disabilities but are not included in the data.

- Of those people wtih a disability that do use the internet, not all will need to use assistive technology.

- I'm only using UK statistics. People can access websites from anywhere in the world, so the figures will actually be far higher.

## Lets do some maths.

Last year, 65,648,054 lived in the UK. Of these, 63% were aged 16-64, and 18% were over 65. Combined, this is around 53.2 million adults. This is from a report published by the Office for National Statistics.

Working out:
`63% of 65,648,054 = 41,358,274`
`18% of 65,648,054 = 11,816,649`
`41,358,274 + 11,816,649 = 53,174,923`


In 2014, 16% of working age people and 45% of people over state pension age were living with a disability. Combined, thats 11.9 million people in the UK alone. Around 1 in 5, or 20%. This is from a report published on GOVUK.

Working out:
`16% of 41,358,274 = 6,617,323`
`45% of 11,816,649 = 5,317,492`
`6,617,323 + 5,317,492 = 11,934,815`

Now, in 2017, only 22% of adults living with a disability said they had never used the internet. This was from another report published by the Office for National Statistics.

So, of our 11.9 million people, we can remove 22% This leaves us with the number people living with a disability that do use the internet. Which is 9.3 million.

Working out:
`22% of 11,934,815 = 2,625,659`
`11,934,815 - 2,625,659 = 9,309,155`

That is almost 10 million people in the UK alone are surfing the web with a disability. *Definitely NOT an edge case.*

One thing I have seen repeatedly from research, is that people always find a way to do things. People are amazing, and will learn and adapt. Those with visual impairments may use screen readers. Those with motor impairments may use a keyboard or voice activation software. 

We have no way of detecting these devices. So, as designers and developers, it is important we design with these people in mind. Having semantic markup, correct tab indexes and accessible content has never been more important. And by making our websites work better for these people, we will automatically make it better for everyone.
