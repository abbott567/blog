Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder. I was 35 when the Psychiatrist confirmed it.

I felt conflicted. I'd spent years in counselling trying to figure out the inside of my own head. I thought I had a pretty good understanding of who I was. Now, I had another piece of the puzzle, but at the same time I doubted if I knew myself at all.

I knew I had quirks. Looking at them now, some of them are textbook ADHD traits, but others are tied to comorbid conditions. I struggle with Impostor Syndrome, Anxiety and Depression, and it's easy to attribute a lot of the traits to those things also.

ADHD was not something I'd really considered. Because, I guess, like most of society; I had a preconceived idea of what ADHD looks like, and it wasn't particularly positive.

ADHD is a complex condition. Simplifying it as 4 words grouped into 3 negative traits doesn't do much to help. 'Attention Deficit', 'Hyperactivity' and 'Disorder' are all unflattering terms. It implies people with ADHD are abnormal, easily distracted and wayward.

Frankly, I think the language is wrong. And here's why.

## ADHD is not always a deficit of attention

The language is largely attributed to observations by Sir George Still in the early 1900s. Still was a British Paediatrician who described some children as having 'an abnormal defect of moral control'. He often described the children as intelligent, but went on to say they could not control their behaviour in the same way 'typical children' could.

But, Still's argument for children having a lack of moral control or a deficit of attention, appears to be entirely based on them being unable to focus on the tasks which he considered to be the priority during the tests.

So, yes, ADHD is a focus problem, but calling it a deficit of attention or suggesting people are too hyperactive to remain focused is often misleading. It's probably why ADHD is misunderstood by so much of society. 

People with ADHD often have an unrivalled ability to hyper-focus, but they cannot always utilise it on tasks which they do not find inspiring. It isn't simply a deficit of attention or being too hyperactive to focus. If anything, it's too much focus or attention to detail, just on the wrong things. 

In the New Zealand language of [Te Reo Māori](https://www.tereohapai.nz/Browse/Terms/mi-NZ), the word for ADHD is 'Aroreretini' which means: 'attention goes to many things'. This is a much more positive way to describe what's going on. It acknowledges that people with ADHD do have an attention span, but not always the ability to focus it.

## Some challenges of ADHD

Like anything, ADHD is a spectrum. Everybody is different, but we do often share common traits. This is my experience of ADHD, but it's important to remember that somebody else's experience might be completely different. 

### Task management

Completing tasks is the most obvious place to start. Our entire work lives and personal lives revolve around setting and completing tasks. 

I can prioritise tasks fine on paper, but executing them in order is a challenge. I'll always gravitate towards the interesting tasks first, or accidentally work on them without realising my attention has drifted from the priority. People who do not have ADHD, or people who are considered 'typical', whatever that means; they seem to be able to prioritise tasks, focus on 1 at a time, and complete them in order until they are all done.

I also find additional tasks when attempting to complete a task, and if it is more inspiring than the one I'm currently doing, my focus unwittingly locks onto that. I sometimes snap back to reality after an hour or so of intensely working on something, only to realise it's the wrong task. There was no deficit of attention. I was laser focused! The thing I was working on was still work related, it just wasn't the priority.

### Timekeeping

My ability to predict time is definitely flawed. My circadian rhythm seems somewhat defective. I can guess a rough time by compiling knowledge and observations. For example, if I can see the sun setting in the sky, and I know it's late December, I can guess its around 4pm. Because I know thats what time the sun sets in December at this specific geographical location.

My partner on the other hand, she can be in a room with no windows and still accurately estimate it's around 4pm. She's rarely more than 15 minutes out, and it blows my mind. To me it's alien. How can you know? How can there just be a gut feeling? I just don't get that.

Because I can't judge time, and because I have anxiety, I'm usually punctual. But that's because I was actually super early and I've just been wandering around or playing on my phone for the past hour.

This lack of instinct for time means I rely heavily on routine and structure. I go to bed because I have to get up for work, not necessarily because I'm ready to go to bed. If I just go to bed when I feel tired, I can quite easily end up nocturnal. My entire sleep cycle just shifts by a few hours a day until it's inverted.

Einstein determined that time is relative. It changes depending on the speed you're travelling. For my ADHD brain, this couldn't be more true!

If my brain is racing, a minute can feel like an hour. If my brain is focused, and hour can feel like a minute.


I'll spend hours perfecting the things I find interesting, and leave myself very little or no time to do the other things. The boring stuff never gets done because I was able to prioritise it. The boring stuff is usually done by working late and stressing out the night before, to make sure I don't let myself or my colleagues down. 

In my personal life, I find impulsivity a challenge. I get consumed by new interests only to often drop when they inevitably get too difficult. I'm a quick learner. I'll obsess over things and develop skills quickly up to an acceptable level, but I rarely have the focus to see any of them through to mastery. 

The pattern is often:
1. Discover a new interesting thing
2. Develop initial skills quickly
3. Obsess about it, researching and learning as much as possible
4. Plateau in my development
5. Invest in better tools or equipment
6. Get frustrated
7. Go back to step 4 a few times
8. Wonder why I ever enjoyed it and quit

Emotions are also a challenge. I struggle with highs that are too high, and lows that are too low. In the extremes I get overwhelmed and my ability to emotionally process anything becomes impaired. It's numbness. Just an absolute lack of feeling for anything good or anything bad. In the past, 


I'm fortunate enough to work in an organisation where I can manage my own time. But, in the past, I've been branded lazy, incompetent and uninterested. Simply because my start time, my tasks, and my finishing time were all dictated by others. If my focus drifted, I failed the task, and there was no additional time to catch up.

It's that catching up time that is a blessing and a curse. To my colleagues, I often appear super productive. I'm a do'er, and I get things done. But they don't see the coping strategies I've developed and executed behind the scenes. The complex diary system. The colour coding. The working late or starting early. The 10 to 15 alarms which go off every single day. All of these things help me to get caught up if I end up focused on the wrong things, but they also inevitably lead to burn out.

If you're like me, before you know it, you'll be a highly functioning ADHD workaholic, churning out 10 to 15 days worth of work in 5 days because you're accidentally working on too many things.

I have good months and bad months. Sometimes I get on top of everything, and I foolishly think I've figured it all out. And then the following month I'm right back in the spiral. If I'm totally honest with myself, I definitely haven't figured out a solution to this problem yet.

People are encouraged to be individuals. There's countless studies which prove but then we assess everyone by the same standards.
