In my role, I deal with many different teams and organisations. I also get involved in a bunch of other things on the side, just because accessibility is so misunderstood. One thing which has become quite apparent is that there are some common misconceptions regardless of which team, department or arms-length body you talk to.

I’ve pulled out 5 of the most common arguments I hear for why people think they should be exempt from doing accessibility work.
1. It’s not citizen facing, only our staff will use it
2. We don’t have any users who use assistive technology
3. The supplier plans to make it accessible at some point
4. Accessibility isn’t a priority right now, we’re working on other features first
5. Accessibility wasn’t part of the original cost, so we need to claim disproportionate burden
