I’ve recently been ranting a lot about primary buttons. But people often don’t understand what they are. In my early days as a designer, I thought it meant adding the class ‘btn-primary’ to my markup, and this is a common mistake.

In the land of user centred design, buttons and links are not interchangeable. The problem is, a lot of people make this mistake and litter the Internet with bad design. That is confusing for the people that use it. Some of my early contributions are still out there causing a nuisance. Sorry.
