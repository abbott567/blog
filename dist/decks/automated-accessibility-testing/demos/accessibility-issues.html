      <h1>Browser tools will find different issues</h1>
      <p class="contrast">
        The text in this paragraph fails colour contrast. 
        All 3 tools should find it.
      </p>
      
      <hr role="presentation">
      
      <h2>Missing alt text</h2>
      <p>
        All 3 tools should find that the following image of a sleepy kitten does 
        not have any alternative text.
      </p>
      <img src="../images/300.jpeg">

      <hr role="presentation">

      <h5>Skipped heading level</h5>
      <p>
        All 3 tools should also find that the heading for this section is a h5 
        and it should be a h2.
      </p>

      <hr role="presentation">

      <h2>Invalid roles</h2>
      <p role="potato">
        ARC Toolkit and Axe DevTools should find that this paragraph is using an 
        invalid role of 'potato'.
      </p>
      <p role="paragraph">
        This paragraph is also using an invalid role of 'paragraph'. But, only 
        ARC Toolkit will find it. Axe will ignore it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wave wont see either as errors and will mark them as features and you'll 
        need to figure out yourself that they're not valid.
      </p>

      <hr role="presentation">

      <h2>Bad link text</h2>
      <p>
        The link after this paragraph is a common accessibility failure as it does 
        not provide enough context. Wave will mark it as being suspicious but Axe 
        DevTools and ARC Toolkit will ignore it.
      </p>
      <a href="#">Read more</a>

      <p>
        ARC Toolkit will pick links up if you use terminology like 
        <a href="#">Click here to view file</a>, but it just shows how varied the tools are.
      </p>
      <p>
        Axe DevTools literally doesn't care about either.
      </p>

      <hr role="presentation">

      <h2>ARC warnings</h2>
      <p>
        ARC will warn that there is no navigation landmark. There isn't a nav 
        menu on this page, so we don't have to fix it. But on most pages you 
        would have a nav element, so it's good that it flags it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It will also flag that there is no bypass blocks method. Again, because 
        there is no header or navigation menu on this page it doesn't matter. But 
        in most cases you'd want to have one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Axe and Wave will not warn you of either of these issues.
      </p>

      <hr role="presentation">

      <h2>Line breaks</h2>
      <p>
        ARC Toolkit will point out that a linebreak is used at the end of this 
        section, even though its a valid use of one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Axe DevTools and Wave will not care.
      </p>
